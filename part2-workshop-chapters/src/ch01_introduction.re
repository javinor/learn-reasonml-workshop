/*
 In `.re` files we write code in Reason syntax which we then compile to javascript.
 Run the following command in a terminal
 ```
 $ npm run build
 ```
 and look in the `.bs.js` file created with the same file name

 The following line was compiled into `console.log("Hello, World!")
 */
Js.log("Hello, World!!");

/*
 Run the following command in a separate terminal window:
 ```
 $ npm run start
 ```

 This will watch your files and re-build when saving.
