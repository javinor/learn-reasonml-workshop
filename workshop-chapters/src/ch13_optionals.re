 Many languages have a concept of "Null", which describes that some data is
 absent. In Reason, we can model the presence/absence data using ordinary
 variants.

 Note: we're defining the [option] type here to show you that it isn't magic.
 In real life you would always use the [option] type provided by the standard
 library.
